# Rock Cycle Game

## Overall goal

My summative task will use processing and vectors to simulate the rock cycle.

I will create different stages of a game in which the user is a rock going through the rock cycle.  

When a user completes the rock cycle, the game will be completed, however they can repeat the levels, since the rock cycle is infinte.

The different stages of the game will represent the different major stages in the rock cycle, interluded by short descriptions of what will happen in the next stage.
* Magma <------------
* Igneous Rock      |
* Sediment          |
* Sedimentary Rock  |
* Metamorphic Rock  |
* Magma ------------>

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class (that we developed earlier together) to allow for the user to move and change velocity and acceleration with arrow keys
* Create "Magma" level in which the user tries to escape the convection currents, in order to become igneous rock
* Create "Igneous" level, in which the user tries to get "hit" by water droplets, in order to become sediment.
* Create "Sediment" level in which the user tries to avoid water flows, in order to be slowly cemented into sedementary rock
* Create "metamorphic" level in which the user tries to reach the magma flow, in order to turn back into magma, and start the rock cycle again.
* Figure out how to display text and information, and create a transition system between levels
