# Rock Cycle Game

## Overall goal

My summative task will use processing and vectors to simulate the rock cycle.

I will create different stages of a game in which the user is a rock going through the rock cycle.  

When a user completes the rock cycle, the game will be completed, however they can repeat the levels, since the rock cycle is infinte.

The different stages of the game will represent the different major stages in the rock cycle, interluded by short descriptions of what will happen in the next stage.
* Magma <------------
* Igneous Rock      |
* Sediment          |
* Sedimentary Rock  |
* Metamorphic Rock  |
* Magma ------------>

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class (that we developed earlier together) to allow for force accumulation (wind, gravity, other forces)
* make the mouse movement translate to a wind force
* make it so that moving the mouse causes the "seeds" of the dandelion to disperse
* modify the visual representation of the Motion class to more closely resembly dandelion seeds
* identify an Arduino sensor that might work to detect air pressure / volume
* program sensor to send values to Processing sketch
* translate sensor output to wind force in sketch
